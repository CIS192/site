# Exceptions, Files, and Modules

In this section, we're going to progress from Python-specific functionality back to familiar paradigms and modules from other languages. The goal for this lecture is to build the foundations to work on larger software projects that you might not be used to (since coursework and problem sets tend to be a little smaller in nature). 

## Exceptions
Sometimes, things go wrong.

## Files
Sometimes, we want to leverage information from the *outside world*. 

### Reading From Files

### Writing To Files

## Modules
Sometimes, we want to *modularize* our codebase into seperate components that can interact with each other.

### Writing Our Own Modules

### Importing First-Party Modules

### Importing Third-Party Modules
