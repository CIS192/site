# Installing Python

## Windows

Visit the official Python website and download the executable Python installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Feel free to use the recommended settings, (namely whichever option automatically adds Python to the `PATH`).

## Mac or Unix

I recommend installing Homebrew [here](https://brew.sh/). Afterwards, you can simply run:

```
brew install python
```

If you restart your terminal, you should see the command line interpreter after running `python3`. You also may need to add a `sudo` before the install command (in the same line), which tells the terminal that the following command is to be run with elevated privileges.
