              Welcome! Python is a powerful interpreted language with both
              imperative and functional paradigms. As one of the fastest growing
              languages of all time, Python is widely used across academia and
              industry; this class is aimed to teach you the skills necessary to
              excel in Python programming, no matter the circumstance. As such,
              this course not only teaches you the latest paradigms, but also
              introduces you to the rapidly growing ecosystem that makes Python
              so powerful.

              <strong>Syllabus</strong> <br />
              After working through the Python fundamentals, this course is
              split into three modules: classical algorithms, web development
              and machine learning. At the end of the course, you will break
              into groups to build a final project of your choosing!
              <br /> <br />
              Some highlights of topics/frameworks include:

              <strong>Grading</strong> <br />
              Six programming assignments count for 60% of the final grade. The
              final project counts for 30% and attendance/participation makes up
              the remaining 10%. There will be ample opportunity for extra
              credit throughout the course! Everybody gets five late days, and
              up to two can be used for a single assignment.

              <strong>Textbook</strong> <br />
              An optional textbook that the course will sometimes refer to is{' '}

                Fluent Python

              , written by Luciano Ramalho. This is an advanced textbook, and we
              will only use it sparingly for more intricate concepts.
