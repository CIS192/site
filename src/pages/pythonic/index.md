# Pythonic Programming
> The "Python" Way of Doing Things

In this lecture, we'll be tackling a variety of Python constructs that are exclusive to the language. A variety of the examples shown today might feel a little contrived, but we'll see later in the course that each and every module shown in this lecture will either be strictly necessary for certain functionality or just incredibly syntactic sugar.

## Objects

## Functions

### Args

### Kwargs

## Iterators

## Generators

## Decorators

## Lambda Functions
