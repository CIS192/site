# Data Structures and Algorithms
> Efficiently Implementing Ideas in Python

Writing efficient code is part of growing as a developer, and it's what seperates real programmers from the weak. Think back to CIS 121, why do we want to use Merge Sort over Bubble Sort? Long answer: it has to do with the complexity of $O(n^2)$ being asymptotically larger than $O(n \operatorname{log} n). Short answer: we care about good practice, and good practice is often nothing more than better performing code, especially in Python. In this lecture, I hope to convince you of this.

Disclaimer: we don't really care about asymptotic complexity much in this class. In fact, we primarily care about lines of code written, unless its **egregiously** poor performing code (think non-polynomial time). That being said, your employer/interviewer/collaborator will definitely care about code performance with theoretical grounding, so in this lecture we will make reference to the Big-O runtimes of various operations.
